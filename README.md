## Project Description
Music platforms generate thousands of listening events every minute, but the true value lies in converting these raw interactions into insights that guide engagement strategy, content decisions, and user experience. This project transforms Spotify listening activity into a dynamic analytics product—combining automated data preparation, DAX-powered KPIs, time-series insights, and interactive storytelling dashboards.  

It provides a clear view of how listeners interact with albums, artists, and tracks over time, enabling smarter content planning, personalized recommendations, and a deeper understanding of user behavior.

## Workflow Summary
A streamlined, professional workflow guided the entire project:

1. **Data Import & Profiling** – Loaded raw listening logs and examined structure, formats, and quality.  
2. **Data Cleaning & Transformation** – Standardized timestamps, derived listening attributes (duration, hour, weekday/weekend, year), and reshaped data using Excel and Power Query.  
3. **Data Modeling & DAX** – Built an optimized star-schema model with KPIs for plays, rankings, YoY trends, engagement intensity, and behavioral metrics.

4. **Dashboard Development** – Created Albums, Artists, Tracks, and Listening Pattern dashboards with drill-through, filters, tooltips, and comparative views.  
5. **Insight Extraction** – Interpreted trends, validated anomalies, and converted findings into actionable recommendations.  
6. **Documentation & Deployment** – Packaged the analysis, visuals, and written insights into a polished, portfolio-ready delivery.

## Problem Statement & Business Needs
Understanding user listening behavior is critical for content strategy, platform engagement, and personalized recommendations. Raw listening logs alone do not reveal which albums, artists, or tracks drive engagement, when users are most active, how content performs over time, or how listening patterns vary by day or hour.  

Stakeholders need a solution that provides structured, actionable insights to:  
- Monitor engagement levels and content performance in real time  
- Identify top-performing and underperforming albums, artists, and tracks  
- Reveal listening habits across hours, weekdays, weekends, and seasons  
- Support playlist curation, marketing campaigns, and recommendation strategies  
- Enable fast, interactive exploration through dashboards for data-driven decision-making

## Analytical Objectives
This analysis was designed to answer high-impact questions:  

1. What are the trends in listening activity across albums, artists, and tracks?  
2. Which content categories show the highest engagement?  
3. How do listening patterns vary between weekdays and weekends?  
4. Which hours of the day record the most activity?  
5. How has listening behavior changed compared to the previous year?  
6. What content has niche but high-value engagement potential?  
7. How can this information support better user engagement and content planning?
